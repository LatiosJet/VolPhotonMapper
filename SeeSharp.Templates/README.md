# SeeSharp experiment template

Base project to develop ray tracing experiments with SeeSharp. Shows how to auto-import Blender scenes (see [Scenes/ExampleScene](Scenes/ExampleScene)), how to configure an experiment (`MyExperiment.cs`), how to setup a benchmark (`Program.cs`), and how to assemble the rendered images in a .pdf (`MakeFigure.py`).
